We will examine how Hastings Park transformed from a 160-acre expanse of thick forest, gullies and marsh in 1889 to what it is today, a mixed use urban park at the north east entrance of Vancouver.<\/span><\/p>","time":{"slots":[{"date":"May  5, 2013","time":" 1:30 PM","duration":"1.5 hours"}],"type":"set"},"map":{"markers":[{"title":"Meeting Place","description":"The corner of Hastings Street and Renfrew Street at the Miracle Mile monument ","style":"stop","lat":"49.281132","lng":"-123.044043"}],"route":{}},"team":[{"type":"you","name-first":"Armin Strohschein","role":"walk-leader","primary":"on","bio":"\r\nMy name is Armin Strohschein.

I began attending the Drop-In program despite being a very shy person. I felt very comfortable talking to the Program Staff. She asked me if I was interested in becoming a volunteer and I was more than happy to try. I put my name on the list for orientation and got accepted as a volunteer. I began doing the Adult Drop-In placement. I began doing a lot of other programs too, Community Dining, Walk Fit Feel Good. We even go to Wasaga Beach in the summer too. I love it. It\u2019s like going on a vacation. The Art Gallery was amazing and the Science Centre. During the winter we go skating at Wallace Emerson, I did not have any knowledge of how to skate but I went and had an amazing time, practice makes perfect. The Bike Project was another one I truly enjoyed because it taught me how to do basic repairs on a bike. We also went to Woodbine Beach and this was my first time ever being there too. I also participated in Bill 114. This summer we will go swimming with the adult drop-in\u2019s program at Wallace Emerson. All this helps me to feel good about myself. I even got the Welcome Policy through Eileen. Now I go to the gym to workout. Thanks to the staff at DPNCHC it\u2019s been an amazing learning experience. I will never forget this, it\u2019s priceless.\r\nSandi Reed:\u00a0Good friend brought me to Davenport Perth Neighbourhood Community and Health Centre. I think it\u2019s a great place to meet people. Down the road I eventually start to volunteer with the Community Dining Program. I also volunteer for the Walk Fit Feel Good Program. I have been with both programs for a few years now.

Danforth east of Pape, often referred to as the \"Other Danforth,\" wasn't really developed until the 1920s, after the Bloor viaduct opened.

A good second step would be to join us for the sixth annual Upper Midway Jane's Walk, as we try to understand how and why this stretch of the Danforth developed as it did, what made it a thriving pedestrian-friendly place for so long, and why it slipped into decline.

The Two Kings are a unique Toronto success story.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>In the case of King-Spadina the area took on new life \u2013 almost immediately. Formerly vacant warehouses and factory buildings were filled with new uses within just a couple of years after the new zoning was implemented and the area has never looked back. Now, a decade later, there is enormous real estate pressure from condominium developers (often aided and abetted by the OMB) who are keen to maximize real estate values which requires the demolition of the historic fabric of the neighbourhood. Will the area be killed by its own success, or will the planners and politicians make sure that the vision that created this lively and vibrant neighbourhood \u2013 so essential to the City\u2019s economy - is protected?<\/p>\r\n<p>On this walk we will, in part, explore one of Jacobs\u2019 precepts in Death and Life of Great American Cities \u2013 that \u201cnew ideas must use old buildings\u201d. Inside the historic buildings of this neighbourhood (and others like it) \u2013 the new ideas, that will fuel our city\u2019s economy long into the future, are percolating. These types of spaces (\u201ca good lot of plain, ordinary, low-value old buildings, including some rundown old buildings\u201d)* are essential and precious to any vibrant urban economy.<\/p>\r\n<p>This walk will commence at the Roastery \u2013 the caf\u00e9 at the entrance to 401 Richmond. 401 was definitely inspired by Jane\u2019s thinking.

Dear\": Unhinging North York's Modesty","shortdescription":"This talk looks at North York's civic centre and surrounding cultural buildings through a post-amalgamation lens, and specifically through the eyes of some local artists slated to install public works over the summer.","longdescription":"<p><img src=\"\/files\/cache\/2dca6fab7726ecfe691a88d4c985e4d9_f437.jpg\" alt=\"3pp1990KirlandPartnershipMelLastmanSquare.jpg\" width=\"525\" height=\"349\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>This walk reflects on North York's centre (Willowdale), a strip of Yonge Street between Sheppard Avenue to the south and Finch Avenue to the north, that provides distinct aesthetic markers of the past 6 decades. A post-war suburban district transformed into North York's city centre, today the area surrounding Mel Lastman Square and the North York Civic Centre, serves as a central post-amalgamation Toronto hub for new Canadians. With its rapidly expanding and changing population, it offers a mix of built conditions: soaring high rises and greater density; the preservation of the wide single dwelling lots that surround its main artery; post-war housing replaced in favour of monster homes; and public art and other planning attempts to both create and dissolve a centralized civic centre created before the 1998 amalgamation of Toronto. This mix today offers a microcosm of frugality and excess, and of new and old urbanism, that progress outside the purviews of critical taste. This talk is an introduction to a multi-site exhibition planned for this summer entitled\"Oh Dear\", which will offer a critique of this area, roughly twenty-five years after its' major civic buildings have been built.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>A \"Dear John letter\" is a letter written to a spouse or partner to inform that a relationship is over because the author has found someone else. Such letters were common and likely originated during war times, when servicepersons were stationed away from home for several months or years, and either they or their partner started a new relationship rather than wait for the original one to return. \"Oh Dear\" is an exhibition that examines and plays with the veneer of modesty and morality typically associated with North York. The project explores a middle road between professionalism and passion, or more precisely, a proletariat-like sorting of work and life. As the title intends, this proposed exhibition and this Jane's Walk embraces both the directness of a \"dear\" letter and the endearment of the \"dearest\" of salutations reserved for those we love and keep close to home.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the project's participating artists who practice, grew up or live in the area will also be at this walk. Presented together with North York Arts.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","time":{"slots":[{"date":"May  4, 2013","time":" 3:00 PM","duration":"1.5 hours"}],"type":"set"},"map":{"markers":[{"title":"Meeting Place","description":"Reflecting Pool at Mel Lastman Square  ","style":"stop","lat":"43.767592","lng":"-79.41346"}],"route":{}},"team":[{"type":"you","name-first":"Paola Poletto","role":"walk-leader","primary":"on","bio":"Paola Poletto's work involves a lot of people with a whole bunch of viewpoints, much like the Surrealists did, and the occasional solitary retreat into craft-based objects.\u00a0She is artist coordinator and co-editor of Oh Dear (RZLBD Post, slated 2013), Tel-talk (Tightrope Books, 2012),\u00a0Boredom Fighters!

This passion led Jay down a gratifying career path working in leadership roles such as Arts Curriculum Writer with the Toronto District School Board, Provincial Grants Officer with the Ontario Arts Council, Director of Communications with DIALOG a premier national architectural firm and a Contributing Columnist with CBC RadioCanada. As a mature student, Jay returned to university to complete graduate research in Narrative Theory and Methodology and now seizes opportunities to contribute to academic and community discourse on narratology and narrative inquiry. She has been a guest lecturer at OISIE, the University of York University, CentennialCollege, Seneca College and other educational institutions. Her writing credits include the Walrus, Toronto Star, Fireweed, Climate Change; Who\u2019s Carrying the Burden and Spacing Magazine. Having grown up in a public housing community, Jay is particularly passionate about shining a light on the incredible capacity of individuals living in TCHC communities likeRegentParkand working with community members to share new stories which exemplify local innovation, kindness and hope.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1998 by the dynamic duo of poet, lyricist, activist, singer and Bengali-rooted tough-guy Rosina Kazi and her life partner, producer, sound designer, philosopher, aphorismist and Barbados-born king of chill, Nicholas Murray, LAL has always proved hard to describe. Their musical experience is wide with Murr having been a member of the seminal hip hop collective, da Grass Roots and designed sound for theatre and film and Rosina , a cultural worker who fuses art and social justice. They\u2019re a band, but not only a band - they're a music making magical mushroom, the visible flowering part of a much larger organism, connected with very fine but infinitely resilient roots.\r\nWe can talk about LAL\u2019s music using words that eventually abandon us: electronica, trip-hop (remember that?), electronic soul, jazz, pop, protest music, justice jams, downtempo beats, lounge, funk, world, multcult, etc etc. Or we can talk about HOW they make music, How they live their lives, how they run their music-making firm and how the line we draw around. LAL takes the long view, they\u2019re in it for the long haul, obsessed with making music but more obsessed with using the making of music as a way to materialize ways of being together, fostering a sharing of resources, ideas and, at bottom, maintaining a tenacious hope that persists despite the frightening world we live in."}],"accessible-info":"Ongoing construction has created uneven terrain at certain spots.

I'm technologically adept, a good listener, and a strong proponent for neighborhood action and activism. I'm also a good writer and editor.\r\nWhy walkability matters to me:\r\nI've been a pedestrian for years - not that we all aren't in one way or another, but I started walking a mile to the bus my freshman year in high school, and realized I really liked to walk. I didn't own a car until I got married at 30, so I spent a lot of time on my feet.\r\nI grew frustrated with the inequity of the power relationship between pedestrians and automobiles, and the sense that our streets were designed to disadvantage pedestrians. So I heard about Feet First in a little note in the PI and went to a meeting (in the food court at Westlake Center no less!) with four or five people...this was in 2000.

We used our Small and Simple grant to hire Alta Planning + Design as our transportation consultant from among three enthusiastic applicants. Beacon B.I.K.E.S. believes that pedestrians and cyclists encounter similar obstacles in getting around our neighborhood and that facilities that address both modes make the most sense.

Alta's final report and recommendation was released June 2011. Our approach is to adopt Portland's innovative greenway network and incorporate it within our unique neighborhood.

Some of these institutions are thriving, others are struggling to survive, and many have folded after years of neglect. The walk is hosted by KUMI,\u00a0 a local women's grassroots movement pooling in women from all\u00a0 the city's sectors to promote cultural and social awareness.<\/p>\r\n<p>We'll start with some introductory words by Brenda Ganot, one of the founders of KUMI who will describe the motivating factors behind organizing a Jane's Walk in Bet Shemesh.\u00a0 Then we'll learn how\u00a0 years ago when Bet Shemesh was much smaller, we had an operating cinema theatre . From there we'll continue to the Zinman Theatre where Yosef Shriki will talk to us about the Andalusian Orchestra and give us a short violin recital. We'll continue to the former Youth Center to learn about the lively theatre company once hosted there. During the walk to The Bet Shemesh Conservatory,\u00a0 Miri Shalem, another KUMI founder will tell us about the cultural activities in Ramat Bet Shemesh. At the Conservatory, music director and pianist Marina Friedman will describe its history, achievements, and challenges. We will also hear a brief classical music recital by some star students. Progressing to the Mifal Pais, Nili Philipp will reveal one of the best kept secrets in Bet Shemesh - our celebrated Classical Chamber Concerts with performances by world renown musicians. Also at the Mifal Pais Avner from Kibbutz Tamuz will share with us details about the film series hosted there. A short walk will bring us to The Pit where Meir Malka will disclose one of the most painful stories of Bet Shemesh: the great void that was supposed to be our cultural center and whose construction is currently held up due to political treachery and corruption, costing the city tens of millions of shekels.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our final stop will be at the Matnas Psagot Hasheva to view a performance of a dance troup with a tour\u00a0 of the Mercaz Volume Music School by Maimon Ben Hamu. For a grand finale, we'll hear a short concert by the Ben Hashmashot 'Twilight' girls choir outside the Matnas.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\"><span>\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05e9

Do you know what the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.saanich.ca\/business\/actionplan\/tillicum.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tillicum-Burnside Action Plan<\/a>\u00a0suggests for each of the places that we visit today?<\/strong>\u00a0What kind of improvements have you noticed in this area over the past few years? How do you think such changes should be implemented?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>2. What is a neighbourhood?<\/strong>\u00a0Do you think of the area we're walking through today as one neighbourhood or many? Are there other neighbourhoods adjacent to our walk? What are their boundaries? What are the benefits and drawbacks of thinking about and planning a city in terms of neighbourhoods?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>3. How should local decisions be made?<\/strong>\u00a0How much power should local residents have? How much power should organizations like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gorgetillicum.ca\/site\/\" target=\"_blank\">GTCA <\/a>or higher levels of government have? How can a neighbourhood make its voice heard?<\/p>\r\n<p>At each of the following sites, we'll consider the following ideas and more specific questions:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Qu'appelle Park<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"The more successfully a city mingles everyday diversity of uses and users in its everyday streets, the more successfully, casually (and economically) its people thereby enliven and support well-located parks that can thus give back grace and delight to their neighborhoods instead of vacuity\u201d (111).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does this park succeed according to Jacobs\u2019 criteria? How could it be improved?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>2. Commerce vs. Homes on Arterials - Burnside from Davin to Orillia<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><\/strong>\u201cTo generate exuberant diversity in a city\u2019s streets and districts four conditions are indispensable: 1. The district... must serve more than one primary function\u2026 2. Most blocks must be short... 3. The district must mingle buildings that vary in age and condition... 4. There must be a sufficiently dense concentration of people.\u201d (150-151).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How well does the stretch of Burnside Road between Davin and Orillia meet Jacobs' criteria for a \u00a0diverse neighbourhood? How could it be improved?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>3. Public Sector Infrastructure<strong> - Tillicum School<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"Schools, like parks, are apt to be volatile creatures of their neighborhoods (as well as being creatures of larger policy). In bad neighborhoods, schools are brought to runiation, physically and socially; while successful neighborhoods improve their schools by fighting for them\" (113).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What role does Tillicum Community School play in this neighbourhood? How does its physical and social presence enhance our neighbourhood? How could it be improved?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>4. Transportation Infrastructure - Burnside and Tillicum<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"Lack of wide ranges of concentrated diversity can put people into automobiles for almost all their needs. The spaces required for roads and for parking spread everything out still farther, and lead to still greater uses of automobiles\" (230).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In what ways could the highway infrastructure at this intersection be improved? How could other forms of transportation be encouraged?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>5. Density, Parking Lots &amp; Major Land Owners - Tillicum Mall, Saanich Centennial Library &amp; Pearkes Arena<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"Massive single uses in cities have a quality in common with each other. They form borders, and borders in cities usually make destructive neighbors\" (257).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does this parking lot create a \"border vacuum\"? What should be done about it? If new buildings were placed adjacent to the street, with underground parking, how would that enhance the public realm?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>6. Successful Mixed Uses?\u00a0<strong>Low Density Commercial &amp; Religious Institutions<\/strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"On successful city streets, people must appear at different times... I have already explained this necessity in social terms while discussing street safety and neighborhood parks. Now I shall point out its economic effects. Most consumer enterprises are just as dependent as parks on people going to and fro throughout the day... If consumer enterprises lie idle for much of the day they may disappear\" (152-153).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is there sufficient density and diversity in this corridor to support storefronts like those in this block? How might we increase the economic viability of commercial enterprises in this area?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>7. Commercial\u00a0Aesthetics &amp; Function<strong> - Fairways Complex<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"The aim should be to get that project... rewoven back into the fabric [of the city]\u00a0\u2013 and in the process of doing so, strengthen the surrounding fabric too\" (392).<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is the Fairways complex working well now? What strategies might be used to make it more functional and aesthetically pleasing?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>8. Finish - Gorgeous Coffee<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Gorgeous Coffee offers the \"bohemian life of [a] coffee house\" (245). Moreover, it\u00a0is a great neighbourhood place to discuss the issues raised during our walk in more depth.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will you join me there after the walk for coffee and more discussion?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><a name=\"Jacobs\"><\/a>* Jane Jacobs,\u00a0<em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities<\/em>, New York: Vintage Books, December 1992 [1961].

That means that each week, we set out on foot, scooter or bike, with our toys in tow, and explore another block in our neighborhood. We meet people who live or work here, find all sorts of fun ways and places to play, and keep an eye out for fellow neighborkids. We snap pics as we go and afterward we write up stories of our adventures, both to remember our discoveries and to share them with everybody else in our neighborhood and community. We hope this will help us all to better tune in and recognize all that's going on around here these days, so that we can make the most of opportunities as they arise and also respond to upsetting stuff as it happens.\r\nCommunity development professionals call neighborhood scavenger hunting an innovative approach to ASSET-MAPPING.

Vi diskuteter hvordan det kan forhindres at terminalen blir en barriere mot sj\u00f8en. PBE og Havnevesenet vil utvide n\u00e5v\u00e6rende terminal. Plansmia har foresl\u00e5tt en sammenhengende park fra Tinkern til Filipstad, med fergeterminal flyttet ut p\u00e5 tuppen av Filipstad, og plassert under et parklokk. Deretter tar vi for oss utbyggingsomr\u00e5det p\u00e5 Filipstad, og sammenligner forslagene fra Plan- og bygningsetaten, Havnevesenet og Plansmia n\u00e5r det gjelder gatenettverk og bebyggelse. Vi f\u00e5r en innf\u00f8ring i de ulike forslagene til tunnell\u00f8sninger for E18, som Vegvesenet n\u00e5 skal utrede.<br \/> <br \/> Det arrangeres Jane's Walk \u00e5rlig i mange land, inspirert av forfatteren og byaktivisten Jane Jacobs, som organiserte motstand mot riving og \u00f8deleggende byfornyelse i New York p\u00e5 60-tallet. Hun har siden inspirert b\u00e5de aktivister og fagfolk over hele verden.

Whether they are English language learners or struggling with self-expression, our schools and communities are overflowing with kids like these.\r\nBased in Toronto, Story Planet is a non-profit that offers free workshops to support children and youth (ages 6-18) in becoming creative and effective communicators.\u00a0 By combining creative writing projects with art, we approach writing and reading with excitement.\u00a0 For many kids who struggle with writing, having a visually creative side to the work enables them to launch their imaginations and get their words flowing. Once writing is fun, it is far less daunting. Often a few small successes are all a child needs to boost their confidence and understand the importance of strong communication skills. From there, the future looks brighter.\r\nStory Planet is inspired and mentored by our friends at 826, a national writing centre for children founded by author, Dave Eggers and educator, Ninive Calegari."}],"accessible-info":"","accessible-transit":"Either Dufferin Subway Station or Ossington Subway Station.
